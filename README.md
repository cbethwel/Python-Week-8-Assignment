# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/caesarmario/our-world-in-data-covid19-dataset). The goal is to understand and visualize the pandemic's progression by examining confirmed cases, deaths and vaccination rates across various countries.

The data is processed, cleane and visualized using Python libraries and insights are derived to inform public health understanding.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
- ✅ Analyze temporal trends (cases, deaths and vaccinations)  
- ✅ Compare metrics between countries (Kenya, India, USA)  
- ✅ Visualize trends using line charts, bar charts and optional choropleth maps  
- ✅ Summarize key findings with narrative explanations
